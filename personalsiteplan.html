      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The concept for the website is a 3D Printing service where people can also request to have the objects printed painted as well. There would be various services offered, from resin printing to filament printing. This would allow for a wide variety of potential clients. The home page would be a display page, showing off the variety of objects printed and an offering of what some of these objects look like painted. There would be several links directing the viewer to alternative pages depending on what they want printed, be it resin or filament. The home page would provide links to a variety of subpages such as an additional gallery, an about us section, a contact section, and so on. </p>
      <P>The benefit of this idea is that people, largely, are lazy, and want other people to do their work for them. I have seen many people talk about how they wish they could get into 3d printing or painting their miniatures, but they just don’t want to get into the hassle of doing it. By offering a website like this they would have the full enjoyment of having their desired objects 3d printed without having to go through the trouble of actually supporting, splicing, and cleaning up the objects themselves. As for why they would use my site as opposed to others, well, convenience for one thing. I could aim to start marking in my local area, which would mean that they don’t have to worry about shipping long distances or being troubled over whether the object will arrive in the mail. Over time I could expand and try to push out into more distant places, but for local college students it would probably be a no brainer.</p>

      <h3>Resin Printing</h3>
      <p>
        The secondary page would be focused on resin printing, which would be for miniatures and fine detailed statues, while filament would be for larger props and sturdier items.  A significant audience would be wargaming and table-top role-players, for whom 3d printed miniatures offer a large range of choices and cheaper prices. For these clients resin printed would be the ideal method of service, and there would also be the option to request having these objects painted for an additional fee. Generally the audience for this type of work would be amateur hobbyists and enthusiasts who do not have the time, space, or finances to own their own 3d printer and would rather commission the work out to someone else instead. Painting would be an additional bonus aspect to this, as there are certainly people who are not the best at painting or neither have the time to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        What would be on this page is a display case of resin printed objects and a commissioning link/form to request objects for printing, with a bonus option to have them painted.

      <h3>Filament Printing</h3>
      <p>
        The Third page would be focused on filament printing. This other type of printing, filament printing, would have a much broader appeal. Filament printing allows for larger print areas and thus bigger prints, and as such with the greater space available the greater the variety of potential objects 3d printed. To name a few potential avenues of appeal through this method, cosplayers could request specific props for their costumes, gun enthusiasts could request special add-ons and modifications for their firearms, people in need of cheap, affordable prosthesis could request prosthetics that won’t cost them egregious amounts of money. Compared to resin printing which usually produces items that are more fragile and smaller in scope, filament printing produces objects that are hardier and larger. The only issue with filament printing is that it typically is not as detailed or fast as resin printing. This would be why we offer both services, the resin option for miniatures and statues/figurines, and the other for practically anything one could need or desire.
      </p>

        This page would have a display case of filament printed objects and a commissioning link/form to request objects for printing and a bonus choice to have them painted.
